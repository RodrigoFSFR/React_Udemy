# React_Udemy
React course files

Course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux

All folders are in the .zip format to reduce commit/push times as there are around 100+ thousand files per folder.

Most commits were reset because an error persisted when trying to use git lfs to bypass the filesize limit

Section 23 is in a different repository: https://github.com/RodrigoFSFR/React_Udemy_Section23
